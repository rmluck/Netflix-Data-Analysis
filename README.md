## Overview

This project aims to analyze the viewing activity of a Netflix account, providing detailed analytics, statistics, and trends to inform the user about the way they use the Netflix service. The program was coded using Python and subsequent Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn. Given a .csv file containing the viewing history of a Netflix account, this program uses past viewing data to conduct analysis and chart graphs based on viewing frequency, viewing duration, viewing location and time, most watched content, and more.

## Contents

This project contains 1 Python file and 1 csv file. The included files are listed below:

* __netflix_viewing_activity.py__: main module that runs the program which analyzes the viewing activity data provided
* __viewing_activity.csv__: sample viewing activity data used to test program

## Program

The instructions on how to run the program and how the program functions are listed below.
